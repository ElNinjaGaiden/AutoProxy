    This is the AutoProxy configuration section used when instanciating ProxyGenerators using the default constructor.
    "Output" is where you want to store the generated file(s).
    Note: the default settings makes your proxies available at http://<yourapilocation>/scripts/proxy
    once a generator was executed.
    "ProxyPerController" is as flag used to tell the generators to create or not 
    a non minified file for each controller that AutoProxy found.

      "Minified" defines if creates or not a minified file containing all proxies generated.
      "Generate" defines if the file has to be created or not
      "Name" will be the name for the minfied file.
      If "generate" == true and "name" is empty, the file name will be "autoproxy.min.js" by default.
